# Synthetic_Data_Pipeline
[In Development] This is the UHS Synthetic Data Production Pipeline

We have opted to use the skunkworks synthetic data pipeline which runs on kedro. This is a new project but we chose to engage with it as we can then grow as it does. It depends on a variety of other dependencies and is MIT licensed (Permissively licensed) as is this project. 

We begin with a simple demonstration of a kedro pipeline.
